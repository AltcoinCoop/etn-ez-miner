Electroneum Easy CPU &amp; GPU Miner

This is a super easy to use electroneum miner front end that is better than the official beginner miner in that it allows you to mine from a variety of different pools and custom pools, as well as allowing for more configurations.

It is also better than a command-line only miner or pre-configured miner in that it has automatic error correction, directly reports pool fees and payouts within the miner window, and does not force you to use a specific miner or pool.

To use it, just start ‘Electroneum Easy CPU or GPU Miner.exe’ from your zip folder, extract it all, enter your address and start mining!

Tells you a pool’s minimum payout and fees within the miner.
